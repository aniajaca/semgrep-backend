INTERPRETATION
================================
TPR (True Positive Rate / Recall): % of real vulnerabilities detected
FPR (False Positive Rate): % of safe code incorrectly flagged
Precision: % of flagged code that is actually vulnerable
F1-Score: Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall
Youden Index: TPR - FPR (benchmark's primary metric)

Industry Benchmarks:
  Commercial SAST Average: TPR 30-40%, FPR 15-60%, Youden ~35%
  Best-in-Class (Qwiet AI): TPR 100%, FPR 25%, Youden 75%
  Academic Tools: F1-Score typically 60-75%
